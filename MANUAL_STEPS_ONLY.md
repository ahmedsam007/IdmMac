# üìã 4 Steps You Need to Complete

## Step 1: Apple Developer Portal (30 minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CANNOT BE AUTOMATED - Requires your Apple ID**

### What to do:

1. **Open browser:** https://developer.apple.com/account
2. **Login** with your Apple ID
3. **Follow this guide:** `SIMPLE_GUIDE.md` - Section "Part 2"

### What you'll create:
- ‚úÖ 2 Certificates (Mac App Distribution, Mac Installer Distribution)
- ‚úÖ 1 App ID (`com.ahmedsam.idmmac`)
- ‚úÖ 1 Provisioning Profile

### Why I can't do it:
- Requires your Apple ID password
- Requires certificate approval from your Mac's Keychain
- Apple security doesn't allow automation

---

## Step 2: Open Xcode (15 minutes)

**Easy! Just follow clicks:**

### What to do:

1. **Open:** `/Users/ahmed/Documents/NanoJet/NanoJet.xcodeproj`

2. **Configure Signing:**
   - Click: Project "NanoJet" ‚Üí Target "NanoJetApp"
   - Click: Tab "Signing & Capabilities"
   - **Uncheck:** "Automatically manage signing"
   - **Team:** Select your team (4H548RMBS5)
   - **Release Signing Certificate:** "3rd Party Mac Developer Application"
   - **Release Provisioning Profile:** "NanoJet App Store Profile"

3. **Test Build:**
   - Product ‚Üí Build (or press Cmd+B)
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Fix any errors if they appear

### Why I can't do it:
- Xcode requires GUI interaction
- Signing configuration needs manual approval

---

## Step 3: App Store Connect (45 minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CANNOT BE AUTOMATED - Requires your Apple ID**

### What to do:

1. **Open browser:** https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. **Login** with your Apple ID
3. **Follow this guide:** `SIMPLE_GUIDE.md` - Section "Part 6"

### What you'll do:
- ‚úÖ Create app record
- ‚úÖ Upload screenshots (take 3-5 of your app)
- ‚úÖ Write description
- ‚úÖ Add privacy policy URL
- ‚úÖ Fill metadata

### Why I can't do it:
- Requires your Apple ID
- Needs manual content entry
- Screenshots must be created by you

---

## Step 4: Build & Submit (1 hour)

**Last step! Almost there!**

### What to do:

**In Xcode:**

1. **Product** ‚Üí **Archive** (takes 5-10 min)
2. When done, **Organizer** opens
3. Click **"Validate App"** (takes 2-5 min)
4. If validation succeeds ‚úÖ
5. Click **"Distribute App"**
6. Select **"App Store Connect"** ‚Üí **Upload**
7. Wait for upload (10-30 min)

**In App Store Connect:**

1. Wait for build processing (30-60 min)
2. Select your build
3. Click **"Add for Review"**
4. Click **"Submit for Review"**

### Why I can't do it:
- Archive requires Xcode GUI
- Upload needs Apple ID authentication
- Submission needs human review
