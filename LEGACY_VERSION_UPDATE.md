# Update Instructions for Legacy Versions

## If you see "404 Not Found" error when checking for updates

This means you're running a very early version of IDMMac (before v0.1.1, released Oct 21).

### How to Update

1. **Download the latest version** manually from:
   https://github.com/ahmedsam007/IdmMac/releases/latest

2. **Delete the old app** from your Applications folder

3. **Install the new version**:
   - Unzip the downloaded file
   - Drag `IDMMacApp.app` to your Applications folder
   - Open from Applications folder

4. **Future updates will work automatically** - Once you're on v0.1.1 or later, automatic updates will work correctly.

### Why This Happened

Early versions of the app were configured with a different update URL that is no longer active. Versions 0.1.1 and later use the correct URL and will receive automatic updates without any issues.

### Current Version Check

After updating, verify you're on the latest version:
- Open IDMMacApp
- Go to menu: `IDMMacApp â†’ About IDMMacApp`
- Version should show **0.2.0** or higher
