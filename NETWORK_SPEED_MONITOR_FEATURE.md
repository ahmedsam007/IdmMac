# Network Speed Monitor Feature

## Overview
A new feature has been added to display real-time network speed (upload/download) in the "Test Connection" button.

## What's New

### 1. Real-Time Network Speed Monitoring
- The app now continuously monitors your network traffic
- Displays current download and upload speeds
- Updates every second with accurate measurements
- Shows "No traffic" when there's no network activity

### 2. Visual Indicator in Test Connection Button
The "Test Connection" button now displays:
- **Download Speed** (green with ↓ arrow)
- **Upload Speed** (blue with ↑ arrow)
- Speeds are shown in a compact format (B/s, KB/s, MB/s, GB/s)

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Files Added:
- `IDMMacApp/Utilities/NetworkSpeedMonitor.swift` - Core monitoring functionality

#### Files Modified:
- `IDMMacApp/App/AppViewModel.swift` - Integrated speed monitoring
- `IDMMacApp/UI/ContentView.swift` - Updated UI to display speeds
- `IDMMac.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Added new file to project

### 4. How It Works

#### NetworkSpeedMonitor Class
- Monitors all active network interfaces (excluding loopback)
- Uses system-level network statistics via `sysctl`
- Calculates speed by measuring byte differences over time
- Thread-safe and efficient with minimal CPU overhead

#### UI Integration
The Test Connection button now shows:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Test Connection     │
│ ↓ 1.5MB/s  ↑ 256K/s│
└─────────────────────┘
```

When there's no network activity:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Test Connection     │
│ No traffic          │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### 5. Technical Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Speed updates every second
- **Accurate Measurements**: Uses system-level network interface statistics
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Monitors all active network connections
- **Low Overhead**: Minimal CPU and memory usage
- **MainActor Compliance**: Thread-safe for SwiftUI integration
- **Combine Integration**: Uses publishers for reactive updates

### 6. Speed Format
Speeds are displayed in a human-readable format:
- < 1 KB/s: Shows in bytes (e.g., "125 B/s")
- < 1 MB/s: Shows in kilobytes (e.g., "512 KB/s")  
- < 1 GB/s: Shows in megabytes (e.g., "1.5 MB/s")
- ≥ 1 GB/s: Shows in gigabytes (e.g., "2.3 GB/s")

Compact format (in button):
- "1.5M/s" for megabytes per second
- "256K/s" for kilobytes per second
- Uses 0-2 decimal places depending on magnitude

### 7. User Benefits

1. **Network Traffic Awareness**: See at a glance if your network is active
2. **Download Monitoring**: Track your actual network usage while downloading
3. **Connection Verification**: Confirm your internet connection is working
4. **No Additional Steps**: Feature works automatically on app launch

### 8. Testing the Feature

1. Launch the app
2. Look at the "Test Connection" button in the top-right area
3. Start a download or browse the web
4. Watch the network speeds update in real-time
5. Click "Test Connection" to open detailed connection diagnostics

## Notes

- The speed monitor starts automatically when the app launches
- Speeds reflect all network traffic on your Mac (not just downloads in the app)
- The monitor is lightweight and runs continuously in the background
- Network speed includes both WiFi and Ethernet connections

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add historical speed graph
- Show peak/average speeds
- Filter by specific network interface
- Export speed data for analysis
- Add speed threshold notifications
