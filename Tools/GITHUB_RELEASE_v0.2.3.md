## üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Extension Context Invalidation

This release fixes the **"Extension context invalidated"** error that occurred when the extension was reloaded or updated while browser tabs were still open.

### What's Fixed

‚úÖ **Extension Context Invalidation Error**
- Extension now gracefully handles being reloaded/updated
- No need to refresh browser tabs after extension updates
- Graceful fallback when background script connection is lost
- Clear, helpful error messages instead of cryptic failures

### Technical Improvements

- Added `isExtensionContextValid()` function to detect invalid extension context
- Added `buildAndOpenDirect()` fallback function for graceful degradation
- Added `chrome.runtime.lastError` checks in all message callbacks
- Made optional features (file size enrichment) fail silently when context is invalid
- Enhanced error handling throughout the extension

### Impact

**Before:** Extension would completely fail after being reloaded, requiring users to reload all open web pages.

**After:** Extension continues to work with graceful degradation (HttpOnly cookies unavailable only), providing a seamless user experience.
