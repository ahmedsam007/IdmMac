üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Extension Context Invalidation

This release fixes the "Extension context invalidated" error that occurred when the extension was reloaded or updated while browser tabs were still open.

What's Fixed:
‚úÖ Extension now gracefully handles being reloaded/updated
‚úÖ No need to refresh browser tabs after extension updates
‚úÖ Graceful fallback when background script connection is lost
‚úÖ Clear, helpful error messages instead of cryptic failures

Technical Improvements:
- Added isExtensionContextValid() function to detect invalid extension context
- Added buildAndOpenDirect() fallback function for graceful degradation
- Added chrome.runtime.lastError checks in all message callbacks
- Made optional features (file size enrichment) fail silently when context is invalid
- Enhanced error handling throughout the extension

Impact:
Before: Extension would completely fail after being reloaded, requiring users to reload all open web pages.
After: Extension continues to work with graceful degradation, providing a seamless user experience.
